Abstract 

Accurate surface-level ozone monitoring is important for maintaining human health. 
In previous research, a Thermo Environmental 49C ozone analyzer was used as a comparison standard to calibrate an Aeroqual S900 ozone sensor modified by PurpleAir (PA) in western Colorado. 
When comparing ozone readings between these two ozone sensors, a significant drop in correlation and PA concentration is observed with increasing temperature. 
The purpose of this project is to create a numerical temperature-dependent model generated from real data that mimics the PA sensorâ€™s behavior. 
In addition, other variables (relative humidity (RH), particulate matter (PM), adsorption, etcetera) will be tested for significance and potentially implemented in this model.
